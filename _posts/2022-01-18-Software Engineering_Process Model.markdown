### Process Flow

(a) Linear Process Flow
Communication &rarr; planning &rarr; Modeling &rarr; Implementation &rarr; Contruction &rarr; Deployment
(b) Iterative Process Flow
((Communication &rarr; planning) &rarr; (Modeling) &rarr; Implementation &rarr; Contruction) &rarr; Deployment

### Incremental Model for Prototype design

It is a part of working system

Initial planning &rarr; Planning &rarr; Requirements &rarr; Analysis & design &rarr; Implementation &darr;(Deployment) &rarr; Testing &rarr; Evaluation

### Spiral Model for Prototype Design

1. It consists of four sections which are repeated until a software is completed

- Determine objective
- Risk Analysis
- Development and Test
- Evaluatin / Plan the next Iteration

2. Difference with prototype model

A system that can be executed and tested from the beginning of the project needs to be developed and checked continuously.

â†’ Trying to minimize risk by finding and managing potential failure factors and risk factors early in the development process.

### Regression testing

- New features should not affect to previous development; Ensure that adding new features to evolutionary prototypes does not accidentally break features working correctly in the previous prototype

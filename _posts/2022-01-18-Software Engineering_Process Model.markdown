### Process Flow

(a) Linear Process Flow
Communication &rarr; planning &rarr; Modeling &rarr; Implementation &rarr; Contruction &rarr; Deployment
(b) Iterative Process Flow
((Communication &rarr; planning) &rarr; (Modeling) &rarr; Implementation &rarr; Contruction) &rarr; Deployment

### Incremental Model for Prototype design

It is a part of working system

Initial planning &rarr; Planning &rarr; Requirements &rarr; Analysis & design &rarr; Implementation &darr;(Deployment) &rarr; Testing &rarr; Evaluation

### Spiral Model for Prototype Design

<b>It consists of four sections which are repeated until a software is completed</b>

- Determine objective
- Risk Analysis
- Development and Test
- Evaluatin / Plan the next Iteration

<b>Difference with prototype model</b>

A system that can be executed and tested from the beginning of the project needs to be developed and checked continuously.

→ Trying to minimize risk by finding and managing potential failure factors and risk factors early in the development process.

### Regression testing

- New features should not affect to previous development; Ensure that adding new features to evolutionary prototypes does not accidentally break features working correctly in the previous prototype
